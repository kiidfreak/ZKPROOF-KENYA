# Project Proposal: Blockchain-Based Identity Verification and Document Management Platform

## Executive Summary

We propose the development of a **Blockchain-Based Identity Verification and Document Management Platform** that leverages decentralized identity (DID) principles and blockchain technology to provide secure, tamper-proof identity verification and document signing services. This platform addresses critical security concerns in digital identity management while demonstrating practical blockchain applications.

## Problem Statement

Current digital identity systems face several critical challenges:
- **Centralized Vulnerabilities**: Single points of failure in identity databases
- **Data Breaches**: Frequent leaks of personal information from centralized systems
- **Lack of User Control**: Users have limited control over their own identity data
- **Document Forgery**: Difficulty in verifying document authenticity and signatures
- **Trust Issues**: Lack of transparent verification processes

## Solution Overview

Our platform provides a **decentralized identity verification system** with integrated document management and electronic signature capabilities, built on Ethereum blockchain technology.

## Core Features

### 1. Decentralized Identity Verification
